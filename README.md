# stalkerware-urls

non-exhaustive list of efforts to begin compiling stalkerware endpoints and IOCs
* may contain false positives

i would like for this to eventually become a more unified, actionable project.

the primary focus is helping protect victims of predators and abusers.

areas of concern:
* victim safety in the event stalkerware comms are blocked
* discreet alerting/detection without blocking to avoid victim endangerment
